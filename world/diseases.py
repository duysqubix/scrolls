class Ataxia(Disease):
    """
    Ataxia is a commona and relatively mild disease found across
    the breadth of Tamriel. Its symptoms include general pain and
    soreness, muscle stiffness, and anemia. Victims of Ataxia are
    often pale, groggy, and irritable. Some particularly devious
    bandits and trap-makers are known to spring vials or lace nails
    with the bodily fluids of dead animals that carry the disease.

    Symptoms
    --------
    Loss of Agility and Strength affecting Subterfuge and Block 
    abilities.

    Carriers
    --------
    Cave Rats; Bears; Alit; Giant Spiders; Slaughterfish; Zombies;
    Traps

    Prognosis
    ---------
    Symptoms are mild for one week. If not cured they can increase
    in severity any time after seven days.

class BrainRot(Disease):
    """
    Brain Rot is a progressively worsening, mind affecting disease.
    It dampens the intelligence, intuition, and mental acuity of its
    victims. Eventually, Brain Rot destroys any semblance of sanity
    and of the self in its victims, leaving them to shuffle in a broken
    stupor until they are cured or die.

    Symptoms
    --------
    Loss of Magicka, Intelligence, and Personality, in that order as 
    the disease progresses.

    Carriers
    --------
    Cave Rats; Zombies; Hagravens; Traps

    Prognosis
    ---------
    Loss of Magicka starts immediately after infection. After one week
    there is a chance that Intelligence will be affected as well. If 
    that occurs then after a further week it is possible to suffer the
    loss of Personality as well, unless cured.
