# The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Mud


Welcome, traveler, to the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Mud. A project that I am shocked hasn't been
undertaken in the world of muds. This is an attempt to bring the world of Tamriel to the comfort of
your terminal and/or client. Based roughly on the rules on [UESRPG][uesrpg] 3rd edition.

The game is open source for now to attract the curious folks and to help contribute to the code. I would like
to think that there are folks out there, as excited as myself, to see a elder scrolls mud. 

The game is powered by [Evennia][evennia], but rewritten to resemble the look and feel of Diku/ROM style 
of muds. Visit the [roadmap][roadmap] to see future planned features and currently completed features. 
Please visit our [contribution][contribute] guidelines if you would like to help out.

UESM is built on the idea of a structured hierarchy of *wizards*, each level having a higher level of power than the next.
I would welcome the opportunity to have folks volunteer to become builders (folks who are assigned zones and build to their hearts) content.
Though *at this stage I wouldn't build anything that you would cry over if lost* simply due to the current state of the project.

The game is currently in *pre-alpha* stage.

The quickest way is to drop by and say hi on our [webclient][webclient_uri]
or point your telnet client to __mud.scrollsmud.com 4040__

## Contribution
